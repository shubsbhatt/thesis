					<h3> This is (not) Media Architecture </h>
					<p> Media Architecture is considered a rather novel phenomenon that interconnects media and architecture in manifold ways. It is a field that encompasses a large number of quite diverse projects. Yet a distinct definition does not exist since Media Architecture as a concept can be rather ambiguous, along with the fact that its theoretical background is rather limited. However, aim of this thesis is not to provide such a definition, rather, it is to offer a deeper understanding of what Media Architecture is, what are its main characteristics and concepts involved.
